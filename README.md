# Ideas

- Add slider to control V-H and diagonal cost of nodes *CHECK*
- Reset algorithm with the same wall and goal nodes configuration *CHECK*
- Add time control, to increase/decrease time step
- Impmenent sorting of nodes with heap rather then sorting a list

# New things

-  A* algorithm
-  Other algorithms for pathfinding
-  Other algorithms in general, like sorting, searching, trees, graphs
